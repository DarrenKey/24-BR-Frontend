Description - 
Another project a couple of the members have been working on is the backend to a battle royale version of the game 24. 24 is a classic card game where four cards are drawn at a time, and the player must get to 24 by creating an equation using each of the cards once as numbers in the equation and using only elementary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Our battle royale version allows players to compete against each other, getting time benefits and deductions for getting questions right and wrong respectively.

Notes about our submission - 
We were unable to fully import our backend (the actual game part), but we did the next best thing to demonstrate our abilities - we imported a chat feature that is available on the deployed site - if you launch another instance of the browser go the "Play" section of our site, type something into the bar, and hit the "submit" button, you have a realtime chatting system.

We also implemented Firestore in our code - however, we were unable to fully implement it in our application due to time constraints. Same with auth, but the Login page allows you to login. Please refer to our DbOps.tsx and AuthUserProvider.tsx!
